## 🎯 Confirmed Events & Strict Team Size Rules

The symposium features **EXACTLY FOUR** authorized arenas. Old events (`CODESPRINT` and `KITTY PARTY 101`) have been completely removed from public routes, APIs, and the admin system.

| # | Event Name | Category | Exact Team Size | Venue | Time Slot | Description |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **01** | **PAPERQUEST** | Technical | **EXACTLY 4 MEMBERS** | Main Auditorium | 10:30 AM – 12:10 PM | Research paper presentation symposium arena before expert faculty evaluators. |
| **02** | **AI FILMFORGE** | Technical | **EXACTLY 1 MEMBER (Solo)** | Main CSE Lab | 10:30 AM – 12:10 PM | Generative AI short film creation and prompt engineering challenge. |
| **03** | **CHECKMATE** | Non-Technical | **EXACTLY 1 MEMBER (Solo)** | Main CSE Lab | 01:40 PM – 03:30 PM | FIDE rapid / blitz knockout chess arena. |
| **04** | **MINE RELAY** | Non-Technical | **EXACTLY 4 MEMBERS** | Auditorium | 01:40 PM – 03:30 PM | Timed puzzle deciphering and obstacle navigation relay race. |

### Strict Team Size Rule:
- ONLY **1 participant (Solo)** OR **4 participants (Team)** are allowed.
- Teams of 2, 3, 5, 6, 7+ members are strictly disallowed and blocked by both frontend form validation and Google Apps Script server validation.
- Allowed Event Combinations:
  - Technical only (PaperQuest or AI FilmForge)
  - Non-Technical only (Checkmate or Mine Relay)
  - One Technical + One Non-Technical (e.g. PaperQuest + Checkmate, PaperQuest + Mine Relay, AI FilmForge + Checkmate, AI FilmForge + Mine Relay)
- At least ONE event is required. Selecting two technical or two non-technical events is blocked.

## 💰 ₹129 Fee Logic & Participant Deduplication

The registration fee is strictly **₹129 per UNIQUE participant**.

### Mathematical Formula:
$$\text{Total Amount} = \text{Unique Participant Count} \times 129$$

### Deduplication Rule:
If a participant competes in both a Technical event and a Non-Technical event, they are counted **only once**. The system never charges a participant twice.

### Real-World Calculation Examples:
- **Example A (PaperQuest + Checkmate):**
  - PaperQuest Team (4 members): *Arun, Rahul, Vijay, Karthik*
  - Checkmate Solo (1 member): *Arun*
  - Unique Participants: *Arun, Rahul, Vijay, Karthik* $\rightarrow$ **4 Unique Members**
  - Total Fee: $4 \times 129 = \mathbf{₹516}$ *(NOT ₹645)*.
- **Example B (AI FilmForge + Mine Relay):**
  - AI FilmForge Solo (1 member): *Arun*
  - Mine Relay Team (4 members): *Arun, Anu, Kavi, Divya*
  - Unique Participants: *Arun, Anu, Kavi, Divya* $\rightarrow$ **4 Unique Members**
  - Total Fee: $4 \times 129 = \mathbf{₹516}$.
- **Example C (Solo Only):**
  - Checkmate Solo (1 member): *Arun* $\rightarrow$ $1 \times 129 = \mathbf{₹129}$.

Both the client Review screen and the backend Apps Script run identical case-insensitive name deduplication to guarantee fee accuracy.

## 🚀 End-to-End Registration Flow

The registration flow is a 6-step interactive wizard accessible at `/registration`:

1. **Step 1 — Participant Details:**
   - Participant enters: Full Name, College Name, Department, 10-digit Phone, Email ID.
   - This person automatically becomes **Member 1 (Main Participant)** for all selected events.
2. **Step 2 — Event Selection:**
   - Technical (Max 1): *PaperQuest* (Team of 4), *AI FilmForge* (Solo), or *No Technical Event*.
   - Non-Technical (Max 1): *Checkmate* (Solo), *Mine Relay* (Team of 4), or *No Non-Technical Event*.
   - Validation ensures at least one event is chosen.
3. **Step 3 — Team Member Details:**
   - If *PaperQuest* selected: Form asks for Member 2, Member 3, Member 4 (all mandatory).
   - If *Mine Relay* selected: Form asks for Member 2, Member 3, Member 4 (all mandatory).
   - If *AI FilmForge* or *Checkmate* selected: Solo event, no extra members needed.
4. **Step 4 — Review & Dynamic Breakdown:**
   - Full summary of participant data and event rosters.
   - Shows deduplicated list of unique attendees.
   - Displays clear pricing breakdown: Total Unique Members, ₹129 fee per head, and Total Amount.
5. **Step 5 — Payment & Dynamic UPI QR:**
   - Real-time dynamic UPI QR code rendered with exact calculated amount.
   - Payee: `PIXEL-3.O`, UPI ID: `gokulkumar1406@okaxis`.
   - "PAY VIA ANY UPI APP" deep link button for mobile devices.
   - "View Static Organizer QR (Reference)" toggle to inspect the fallback organizer image.
   - Participant enters the 12-digit UTR / Transaction Reference ID.
   - Double-click and duplicate submission prevention disabled on click.
6. **Step 6 — Confirmation & Pass:**
   - Displays official Registration ID (e.g. `PIXEL-3.O-001`).
   - Payment Status marked as `Submitted` (awaiting admin audit).
   - **"JOIN PIXEL-3.O WHATSAPP GROUP"** button: Direct invite link to `https://chat.whatsapp.com/EcA1kG8VThJFx58Qmr2l1v`.
   - **"DOWNLOAD CONFIRMATION PASS"** button: Generates an official text pass with all symposium reporting details.

## 💳 UPI Payment System (Dynamic & Static QR)

### 1. Dynamic UPI QR:
The website encodes the exact total calculated fee dynamically for every user:
```
upi://pay?pa=gokulkumar1406@okaxis&pn=PIXEL-3.O&am={TOTAL_AMOUNT}&cu=INR&tn={REGISTRATION_NOTE}
```
* **₹129:** `upi://pay?pa=gokulkumar1406@okaxis&pn=PIXEL-3.O&am=129&cu=INR&tn=PIXEL-3.O`
* **₹516:** `upi://pay?pa=gokulkumar1406@okaxis&pn=PIXEL-3.O&am=516&cu=INR&tn=PIXEL-3.O`

### 2. Static Reference QR:
- Located at `/Payment-Qr.jpeg` in the public folder.
- Contains the official static Google Pay UPI QR for `gokulkumar1406@okaxis`.
- Available inside a clean collapsible accordion on the payment step as a reference fallback for manual entry.

## 📊 Google Sheets Backend Architecture (`Code.gs`)

### Live Google Apps Script Web App Endpoint:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxzUn5hFzvTP3GotvliByvdKDeMBLAO61WLjbpMe_yGCMNISsF7l11VeCPRKcwsbZ5Meg/exec
```

### Google Spreadsheet Specifications:
- **Spreadsheet Name:** `PIXEL-3.O – Event Registrations 2026`
- **Tab Name:** `Registrations` (Single tab only. No separate tabs for events or payments).
- **Storage Rule:** Every registration creates **EXACTLY ONE ROW**.

### Exact 23 Columns Order:
1. `Registration_ID` (Concurrency-safe format: `PIXEL-3.O-001`, `PIXEL-3.O-002`...)
2. `Full_Name`
3. `College`
4. `Department`
5. `Phone_Number`
6. `Email_ID`
7. `Technical_Event`
8. `Technical_Member1`
9. `Technical_Member2`
10. `Technical_Member3`
11. `Technical_Member4`
12. `Non_Technical_Event`
13. `Non_Technical_Member1`
14. `Non_Technical_Member2`
15. `Non_Technical_Member3`
16. `Non_Technical_Member4`
17. `Total_Members`
18. `Fee_Per_Head` (`129`)
19. `Total_Amount`
20. `Payment_Status` (`Submitted` by default, `Paid` upon admin verification)
21. `Payment_ID` (UTR Transaction reference)
22. `Registration_Status` (`Confirmed` / `Cancelled`)
23. `Registered_AT` (IST Timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss IST`)

### Concurrency & Deadline Safety:
- Employs `LockService.getScriptLock()` with a 30-second concurrency lock to prevent race conditions on simultaneous submissions.
- Uses `PropertiesService.getScriptProperties()` for continuous, incremental numbering.
- Rejects new public submissions automatically after **13 October 2026, 10:00 PM IST** (`DEADLINE_EPOCH`).
